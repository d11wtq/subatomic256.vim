# subatomic256.vim

This is a colorscheme for Vim, which originally started out as a port of
[subatomic](https://github.com/cryon/subatomic) for Emacs. It has been modified
quite a lot from the original and is specifically designed to work well in
256 color terminals. Both dark and light themes are provided. Make sure to set
the background *before* you set the colorscheme.

    set background=light
    colorscheme subatomic256
